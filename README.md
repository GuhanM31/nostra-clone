This is a clone of the Nostra website built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of this project is to replicate the design and functionality of the original Nostra website, providing a similar user experience using modern web technologies.

## Features

- Fully responsive design, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Tailwind CSS used for fast styling and layout.
- Interactive elements with JavaScript.
- Includes animations, hover effects, and other UI elements.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML5** for the structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and functionality.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (optional, for development)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, if using npm)
- **Tailwind CSS** (we will include this in the project setup)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nostra-clone.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

    ```bash
    cd nostra-clone
    ```

3. **Install dependencies** (optional if you're using Tailwind CLI or PostCSS):

    You can use **Tailwind via CDN** for simplicity or set it up through npm for a more robust development environment. If you choose npm:

    - Initialize npm if you haven't yet:

        ```bash
        npm init -y
        ```

    - Install Tailwind CSS:

        ```bash
        npm install -D tailwindcss
        ```

    - Initialize Tailwind configuration:

        ```bash
        npx tailwindcss init
        ```

    - Create a `tailwind.config.js` file if you don't have one, and add the following:

        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
          content: [
            "./index.html",
            "./**/*.html",
            "./**/*.js",
          ],
          theme: {
            extend: {},
          },
          plugins: [],
        };
        ```

    - Add Tailwind to your CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`):

        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
